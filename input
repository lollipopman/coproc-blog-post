Remove dead code! :blue_heart: :blue_heart: :blue_heart: :blue_heart: :blue_heart:

This code can go the way of the wonderful :sauropod: as our :flying_saucer:
tech has been replaced with:

	#!/bin/bash
	msg='Sorry we have gone out of business! :flying_saucer: :zombie:'
	printf '%s\n' "$msg"
	exit 0

I suppose it is not that easy after all to build a product based on a
:flying_saucer: or to innovate and build a better :fortune_cookie:, good luck
next time :blue_heart: :blue_heart:!
