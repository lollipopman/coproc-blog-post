Remove dead code! :blue_heart: :blue_heart: :blue_heart: :blue_heart: :blue_heart:

This code can go the way of the wonderful :sauropod: as our :alembic: tech has
been replaced with:

	#!/bin/bash
	msg='Sorry we have gone out of business! :alembic: :coffin:'
	printf '%s\n' "$msg"
	exit 0

I suppose it is not that easy after all to build a product based on an
:alembic: or to innovate and build a better :bathtub:, good luck next time
:blue_heart: :blue_heart:!
