Remove dead code! :red_heart: :red_heart: :red_heart: :red_heart: :red_heart:

This code can go the way of the wonderful :sauropod: as our :nesting_dolls:
tech has been replaced with:

	#!/bin/bash
	msg='Sorry we have gone out of business! :headstone:'
	printf '%s\n' "$msg"
	exit 0

I suppose it is not that easy after all to build a product based on
:nesting_dolls: or to innovate and build a better :mouse_trap:, good luck next
time :red_heart:!
