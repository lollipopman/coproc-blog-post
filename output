Remove dead code! ğŸ’™ ğŸ’™ ğŸ’™ ğŸ’™ ğŸ’™

This code can go the way of the wonderful ğŸ¦• as our ğŸ›¸
tech has been replaced with:

	#!/bin/bash
	msg='Sorry we have gone out of business! ğŸ›¸ ğŸ§Ÿ'
	printf '%s\n' "$msg"
	exit 0

I suppose it is not that easy after all to build a product based on a
ğŸ›¸ or to innovate and build a better ğŸ¥ , good luck
next time ğŸ’™ ğŸ’™!
