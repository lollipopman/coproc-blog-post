Remove dead code! 💙 💙 💙 💙 💙

This code can go the way of the wonderful 🦕 as our 🪆
tech has been replaced with:

	#!/bin/bash
	msg='Sorry we have gone out of business! 🪆 🪦'
	printf '%s\n' "$msg"
	exit 0

I suppose it is not that easy after all to build a product based on
🪆 or to innovate and build a better 🪤, good luck next
time 💙 💙!
